This is a repo containing a bunch of sample languages for testing syntax styling with the UUU syntax and UI builders.

## Usage
1. Open this project in Atom
1. Goto View > Developer > Open In Dev Mode. Navigate to this uuu-langauage directory and open it. This will enable live reloading of the window as you make style changes.
1. Again, Goto View > Developer > Open In Dev Mode. Navigate to uuu-language/foloder director and open that too. Goto Settings > Themes and click on the gear icon to access settings for UUU-SYNTAX and UUU-UI
1. Now, when you change the setting in the setting in one project window, you can see everything update in both project windows.
1. Just start at the top of the settings and work your way down. Make one change, check it out and then keep going.
